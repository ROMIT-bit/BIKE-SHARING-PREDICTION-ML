# BIKE-SHARING-PREDICTION-ML
MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

this project is on prediction of bike sharing with various environmental condition as a features.

## link to download dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset

NOTE: there are two dataset namely hour and day. this project is on hour dataset.

for this purpose i used machine leaning and deep learning models.

## 1) machine learning : 

            A)DECISION TREE (WITH HYPERPARAMETERS TUNING)

            B)RANDOM FOREST (WITH HYPERPARAMETER TUNING)

## 2) deep learning :

            A) ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN)
